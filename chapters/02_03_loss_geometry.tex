\section{Geometry of Neural Networks}\label{section:geometry_of_nns}

\subsection{Symmetries of Neural Networks}

Also introduce mode connectivity here, before canonical reps 

Introduce permutation and scaling symmetries, and maybe other symmetries if we end up using them. 

\subsection{Canonical Representations of Neural Networks}

Mainly based on the deep toroids paper
